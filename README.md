# ArtGallery

ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Art Gallery Application Project! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
I recently developed an art gallery application that brings the world of art closer to audiences while providing a smooth, accessible experience for both artists and customers. This platform not only showcases artwork but also hosts virtual exhibitions and enables customers to purchase art pieces securely.
Tech Stack:
-Frontend: React, CSS, JavaScript, HTML
-Backend: Node.js, MySQL
Key Features:
-Artists can register, manage their profiles, and display their artwork.
-Customers can view available artwork, participate in exhibitions, and make purchases.
-User-friendly and visually appealing UI to enhance the art viewing experience.
-Working on this project was an amazing journey of integrating creative expression with technology.
